# Tea Theme Options


## Simple, easy to use and fully integrated Theme Options Plugin for Wordpress.

The [Tea Theme Options](http://takeatea.github.com/tea_to_wp/) (or **Tea TO**) allows you to easily add professional looking theme options panels to your WordPress theme. The **Tea TO** is built for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org "CMS Wordpress") v3.x and uses the Wordpress built-in pages.

+ [**Options API**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API) - A simple and standardized way of storing data in the database.
+ [**Transients API**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API) - Very similar to the Options API but with the added feature of an expiration time, which simplifies the process of using the wp_options database table to temporarily store cached information.
+ **Wordpress Media Manager** - Beautiful interface: A streamlined, all-new experience where you can create galleries faster with drag-and-drop reordering, inline caption editing, and simplified controls.
+ **Full of Options** - 4 kinds of options used to display information, store fields values or get data from your Wordpress database. The options are made to build your Wordpress pages easily.
+ **Easier for administrators** - The interface is thought to be the most userfriendly. The Tea TO core adds some extra interface customisations to make your life easier.
+ **Easier for developers** - Create a new admin panel easily with the new dashboard. The Tea TO core is made to allow non-developer profiles to easily create the settings they need to customise their templates.
+ **Custom Post Types** - Create a custom post type from your uniq dashboard easily.

Adding fields is quite simple. All you have to do from the **Tea T.O.** page is to click on your wanted page and use the bottom Adding contents form. For each field, just follow the instructions and fill the form simply.
