== Description ==

The [Tea Theme Options](http://takeatea.github.com/tea_to_wp/) (or **Tea TO**) allows you to easily add professional looking theme options panels to your WordPress theme. The **Tea TO** is built for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org "CMS Wordpress") v3.x and uses the Wordpress built-in pages.

* [**Options API**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API) - A simple and standardized way of storing data in the database.
* [**Transients API**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API) - Very similar to the Options API but with the added feature of an expiration time, which simplifies the process of using the wp_options database table to temporarily store cached information.
* **Wordpress Media Manager** - Beautiful interface: A streamlined, all-new experience where you can create galleries faster with drag-and-drop reordering, inline caption editing, and simplified controls.
* **Full of Options** - 4 kinds of options used to display information, store fields values or get data from your Wordpress database. The options are made to build your Wordpress pages easily.
* **Easier for administrators** - The interface is thought to be the most userfriendly. The Tea TO core adds some extra interface customisations to make your life easier.
* **Easier for developers** - Create a new admin panel easily with the new dashboard. The Tea TO core is made to allow non-developer profiles to easily create the settings they need to customise their templates.
* **Custom Post Types** - Create a custom post type from your uniq dashboard easily.

== Installation ==

**To get started**, checkout or download the https://github.com/takeatea/tea_theme_options package into the `wp-content/plugins/`

    git clone https://github.com/takeatea/tea_theme_options

Check your new `tea_theme_options` folder is created in your plugins directory.


Go to your plugins page `your_wp_website/wp-admin/plugins.php` and enable the Tea Theme Options plugin.

Create your new first page settings (as capability, description and submit button).
Click on the **Tea T.O.** page, select the **Add a custom page** menu and fill the form.
NOTA: all created pages will only appear if contents are defined.

Repeat the process as you want/need :)
You can easily create Custom post types from the **Add a custom post type** menu: as usual, just fill the form.


All you have to do from the **Tea T.O.** page is to click on your wanted page and use the bottom Adding contents form. For each field, just follow the instructions and fill the form simply.
NOTA: the **Tea TO** uses [Transient Wordpress API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API) to stock options.


Here is the latest step: check quickly your new panel options.

* Go to your `your_wp_website/wp-admin`
* Log in to your admin panel
* **See that you have a new Link in your admin sidebar**

That's all to begin working with **Tea TO**
